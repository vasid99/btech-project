# B.Tech Project

This repository contains code written as part of the final year undergraduate project titled **"Exploring Resource-Performance Tradeoffs In Golden Gate"**. There are two subprojects contained within this repository - 

(1) **Chisel3-RV32I-CPU**: HDL and simulation code for a 32-bit processor using the RV32I instruction set
(2) **firesim-cam-files**: Source code for compilation and software simulation of content addressable memories (CAMs) in FireSim's decoupled FPGA simulation environment
